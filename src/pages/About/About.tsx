        Kickstarting Institutional Repositories -- 2011-2013
      </Title>
      <Text size="xl">
        In my new career as Emerging Technologies Librarian, I used my coding
        skills to automate workflows for institutional repositories. The College
        of Wooster had recently invested in an institutional repository that was
        in need of high quality content. I successfully led the effort to create
        a digital submission requirement for Senior Independent Study Theses,
        undergraduate capstone projects that would find a permanent digital home
        in our repository. Next, we began to recruit faculty members to upload
        their research to promote open access publishing. Many journals allow
        their authors to publish their peer reviewed drafts (aka post-prints) to
        institutional repositories, which could be low-hanging fruit in
        recruiting content. The challenge is figuring out which journals do
        that, and which faculty publish in those journals. I authored a custom
        Google Sheet function in JavaScript that streamlined identifying Wooster
        faculty publications in journals with friendly open access policies,
        allowing us to take a 12 hour project and automate it in 15 minutes. I
        published my findings in Code4Lib and presented a poster at the
        Association of College & Research Libraries conference.

        Teachers Are So Busy! -- 2016-2023
      </Title>
      <Text size="xl">
        I wanted to pursue a passion for teaching, and took a position as an 8th
        Grade History teacher in Columbus. When I started, almost every major
        workflow was paper-based. Absent student for a test? -- paper ticket
        goes into folder. Major comprehensive exams? -- printed on paper,
        scanned and fed through software to produce reports. Paper has some
        wonderful use cases, but this definitely wasn't one of them. I quickly
        worked to digitize many school processes, and became a go-to resource
        for other teachers wanting to do the same. I spearheaded the adoption of
        {" "}<Anchor href="http://www.edulastic.com" target="_blank">
          Edulastic
        </Anchor>
        , so all quizzes, tests and comprehensive exams could be completed on
        Chromebooks with automatic grading. I created Google Sheets with query
        formulas so each grade level could keep a central spreadsheet to track
        students missing tests.
      </Text>
      <Text mt="lg" size="xl">
        During remote learning, there arose a heightened imperative for teachers
        to regularly contact families to report on their student's progress. I
        created a Google spreadsheet that used a model to predict a student's
        daily academic activity, and when their behavior was not as expected,
        used that occasion to start a dialog with the family. I had some
        straight A students, which the model would predict a {">"}95%
        probability of completing their daily work. If one of those students
        didn't turn in their work, the model would alert me to the unexpected
        behavior, allowing me to make my communication home much more targeted
        and based on real-time data.
